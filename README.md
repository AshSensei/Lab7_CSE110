## Check Your Undestanding Questions
1) Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline?

Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. This makes it so whenever you push code you can make sure it complies with the tests that ensure the functions and components work properly as well as following any lint or formatting guidelines. This also can ensure consistent code before merging pull requests.

2) Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output? (yes/no)

No, end to end tests are to make sure interaction with components from a user perspective is correct.

3) What is the difference between navigation and snapshot mode?

Navigation mode gives a performance metric based on right when the page loads while the snapshot mode looks at the current state of the webpage when the report is generated/page is selected to be analyzed.

4) Name three things we could do to improve the CSE 110 shop site based on the Lighthouse results.

To improve the CSE 110 shop site we could change the sizing of some image to improve loading time and save data, preload larger images to improve performance, and add a `<meta name="viewport">` tag to optimize for mobile screen sizes and reduce user input lag.
